Introduction
------------
This is a simple wrapper for box2d using Openframeworks. The examples below are still in progressive, but should be stable for the most part. Please open up a issue if you have suggestions or find bugs. The wrapper is using the version Box2D v2.3

Thanks,
Todd

Instructions
------------
When making a vector of objects you need to be careful. You either need to make a vector of pointers of use the `shared_ptr` object.     
    
Everytime you push into the vector `circles` the object is destroyed and the created.
This causing issues for the `b2dBody body` object owned by box2d.       
  
        
***Incorrect way to store objects.***         
```
vector <ofxBox2dCircle> circles;
ofxBox2dCircle circle;
circles.push_back(circle);
```

***Here is the how to create a vector of box2d objects.***   
```
// in your header files
vector <shared_ptr<ofxBox2dCircle> > circles;


// now add a circle to the vector
shared_ptr<ofxBox2dCircle> circle = shared_ptr<ofxBox2dCircle>(new ofxBox2dCircle);

// to grab the pointer you use the get() function of shared_ptr (std::shared_ptr)
circle.get()->setPhysics(3.0, 0.53, 0.1);
circle.get()->setup(box2d.getWorld(), 100, 100, 10);
circles.push_back(circle);
```

Installation
------------
Place ofxBox2d within a folder in the apps folder of the OF dir tree:
<pre>
openframeworks/addons/ofxBox2d
</pre>

Compatibility
------------
The `master` branch is compatible with [the current release of openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/download/), and the `develop` branch tries to stay up to date with openFrameworks on GitHub.
