Introduction
------------
This is a simple wrapper for box2d using Openframeworks. The examples below are still in progressive, but should be stable for the most part. Please open up a issue if you have suggestions or find bugs. 

Thanks,
Todd

Installation
------------
Place ofxBox2d within a folder in the apps folder of the OF dir tree:
<pre>
openframeworks/addons/ofxBox2d
</pre>

Compatibility
------------
ofxBox2d is developed against the current version of OpenFramewroks.

If you are using a stable version (007, 0071, ...) of OpenFrameworks then you want to use a git tag of ofxBox2d for that version. You can select the tag in the Github "Current Branch" menu or clone and check it out using git.

For example, the following commands will clone ofxBox2d and switch to the OF 007 tagged version:
<pre>
git clone git://github.com/vanderlin/ofxBox2d.git
cd ofxBox2d
git checkout 007
</pre>
